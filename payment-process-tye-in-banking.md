⭐ **How UOB Cards Work on a Merchant Website (Online Payment Flow)**

When you pay on an e-commerce site with a UOB Visa/Mastercard, multiple systems work together:

1.	You enter card details on the merchant’s checkout page.  
2.	The merchant’s payment gateway encrypts the card data.  
3.	The gateway sends the data to the card network (Visa/Mastercard).  
4.	The card network routes it to UOB (issuer bank) for authorization.  
5.	UOB checks: card validity **|** available credit/balance **|** fraud risk **|** 3-D Secure (e.g., UOB Mighty Secure) authentication.  
6.	UOB sends approve/decline back through the network.  
7.	Merchant receives confirmation and completes the order.  
8.	The financial settlement happens later (batch clearing).
