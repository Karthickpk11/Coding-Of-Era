Step 3: Key Points / Suggested Answers
* Always give concise explanation + example from your experience
* Highlight ownership & leadership
* Example:
  - Q: “How do you handle production incident?”
  - A: “First I analyze logs (CloudWatch/Splunk), identify root cause, implement fix in dev/test, coordinate with team, communicate status to client. Reduced downtime by X%.”
    
	* Emphasize Mentoring Juniors / Team Ownership / Critical Thinking
